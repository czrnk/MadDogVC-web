		<h4><u>External Links</u></h4>
		<p>We may provide links to various websites that we do not control.  When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our Website and connected to the website of the organization that you selected.</p>
		<p>We are not responsible for the nature, quality or accuracy of the content or opinions expressed on such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for quality, accuracy or completeness by us.</p>
		<p>Inclusion of any linked website on our Website does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked website by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these websites. Even if an affiliation exists between our Website and a third-party website, we exercise no control over linked sites.</p>
		<p>Each of such linked websites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures.  While we expect our business partners and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties.  If you visit a website that is linked to or from our Website, we encourage you to consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any personal information and whenever interacting with any website.</p>

		<h4><u>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</u></h4>
		<p>You may also send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@maddogtechnology.com"> info@maddogtechnology.com</a> to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us.

		<h4><u>Your California Privacy Rights</u></h4>
		<p>Under California Civil Code § 1798.83, residents of the State of California that have provided any personally identifiable information to us have the right to request a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed personally identifiable information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, the law provides that if we have a privacy notice that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of personally identifiable information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, we may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.  In compliance with the second alternative, we have established this Website Privacy Notice that provides you with details on how you may either opt out or opt-in to the use of your personally identifiable information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>
		<p>Additionally, CalOPPA requires us to disclose how we respond to “do-not-track” requests from our users. At this time, we do not currently respond to “do-not-track” requests from our users’ browsers.</p>
		
		<h4><u>Data Security</u></h4>
		<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any, administrative pages will be encrypted using SSL technology. Furthermore, we strive to only store information that is necessary, and only for so long as such information is necessary.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</p>
		
		<h4><u>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</u></h4>
		<p>on the Website home page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ Personal Information, we will notify you through a notice on the Website’s home page. The date the Privacy Notice was last revised appears at the beginning of this Notice.
